# Share2Care
This project basically aims to bridge the gap between the Donor and the NGO's, this targets our own problem where we want to donate items to the needy but don't know how to and where to reach them, this is where Share2Care helps you.
You can post the items you want to donate and for every upload you get some of our coins that you can furthur redeem in exchange of some exciting goodies.
Whenever any NGO order your items you can see the status of that item for e.g whether it is recieved by the NGO or not , whether it is distributed among the needy or not.
Similarly the NGO's can also see all the details like who donated, when they ordered,etc.
To reduce the delivery we have created the backend in such a way that the NGO's sees only those items that are within the same state.
This project is completely dynamic.
This project uses HTML,Bootstrap,PHP,phpmyadmin as the tech stack.
